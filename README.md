# discord-file-downloader-bot
A [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) bot, used to download every file in channels that it can see. Useful for servers based around NSFW content.

Change variables at the start of `main.py` to use with your own server / bot.

Use `restfulapi-version.py` for saving files using [my MyBB-RESTful-API-system extensions, specifically FileUploadAPI](https://github.com/Pruffer/MyBB-RESTful-API-System-extensions).
